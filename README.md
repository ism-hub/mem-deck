# MemDeck
MemDeck is a Web App geared towards helping you memorize a deck of cards using [Dominic's Person-Action system](https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Dominic_System). 
You add the person-action and card mapping, memorize the cards in pairs and the App saves the order for you for the time you want to check if you remembered the correct order.

# What We Have So Far
Not a lot,
  - Angular + Redux setup.
  - The site as an Environment in git - [MemDeckApp](https://ism-hub.github.io/mem-deck/).
  - Can move and flip cards on a canvas.

# TODO
 - A button to shuffle and to arrange the cards in pairs (Person-Action).
 - A view to show and navigate between the pairs.
 - Saving the state from use to use.
 - Saving/Editing the action-person-card mapping.
 - Can click on a card and see the person-action attached to it.

# How To Use
Web-App (for now on git) just enter the link - [MemDeckApp](https://ism-hub.github.io/mem-deck/).

# Development 
Standard Angular -

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
